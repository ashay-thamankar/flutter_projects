# bmi_calculator

A new Flutter project.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height. It serves as an indicator of whether a person's weight falls within a healthy range in relation to their height. BMI is widely used in healthcare to assess the potential health risks associated with underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. It provides a simple and quick way to gauge whether an individual's weight is proportionate to their height, assisting in the identification of potential health concerns and informing discussions about lifestyle and wellness.
